name: Deploy Site

# NOTE: This workflow is disabled because the Next.js site uses middleware
# for i18n routing, which requires a server runtime (not static export).
# Deploy to Vercel instead: https://vercel.com/new
#
# To re-enable for static export:
# 1. Remove middleware.ts
# 2. Add output: 'export' to next.config.ts
# 3. Change artifact path to www/out

on:
  # Disabled - use Vercel for deployment
  # push:
  #   branches: [main]
  #   paths:
  #     - 'www/**'
